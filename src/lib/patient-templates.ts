  insomnia: `
## **Understanding your condition**
Difficulty sleeping is very common and often triggered by stress, routine changes, or caffeine. It is frustrating, but short-term insomnia usually improves within a few weeks by adjusting your habits, rather than taking sleeping pills which can stop working quickly.

## **Things that can help**
- **The 20-minute rule:** If you cannot sleep, do not lie there awake. Get up, go to a dim room, and read a boring book until you are sleepy.
- **Fix your wake-up time:** Get up at the exact same time every day to reset your body clock, even after a bad night.
- **Limit screens:** The light from phones and TVs wakes your brain up. Avoid them for 1 hour before bed.
- **Cut caffeine:** No tea, coffee, or energy drinks after 2pm.

## **Extra support**
- **Sleepio:** A digital NHS-accredited programme using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for insomnia.
- **NHS.uk:** Search "Sleep problems" for a full guide.

## **When to get help**
Contact your GP or 111 if:
- Your lack of sleep is affecting your safety (e.g., while driving).
- You have trouble sleeping for months despite trying these changes.
- You wake up gasping or choking (signs of sleep apnoea).

  "back pain": `
## **Understanding your condition**
Back pain is very common but rarely caused by serious damage. In most cases, it is a simple muscle or ligament strain. Your spine is strong and designed to move; resting in bed actually slows down recovery.

## **Things that can help**
- **Keep moving:** This is the most important step. Gentle walking and continuing normal activities as much as pain allows will speed up healing.
- **Heat or Cold:** Use a heat pack or ice pack (wrapped in a towel) for 15–20 minutes to reduce muscle spasm.
- **Pain relief:** Taking ibuprofen or paracetamol regularly for a few days can help you stay active (check the label first).
- **Stay at work:** If possible, stay at work or return as soon as you can, even if you are not 100%.

## **Extra support**
- **Versus Arthritis:** Search for "Back pain exercises" on their website for safe movements.
- **Self-Referral Physio:** Check if your local NHS trust allows you to book physio without a GP appointment.

## **When to get help**
**Call 999 or go to A&E immediately if:**
- You have difficulty passing urine or controlling your bowels.
- You have numbness around your bottom or genitals.
- You have weakness in your legs.
- **Call your GP** if the pain does not improve after 4–6 weeks.

  uti: `
## **Understanding your condition**
A UTI occurs when bacteria enter the bladder, causing stinging when you pee, a need to go often, or tummy pain. Mild infections often clear up quickly with antibiotics or self-care.

## **Things that can help**
- **Drink plenty of fluids:** Water helps flush the bacteria out of your bladder.
- **Pain relief:** Paracetamol or ibuprofen can reduce pain and lower a high temperature.
- **Rest:** Give your body energy to fight the infection.
- **Avoid sex:** Wait until you feel completely better to avoid irritating the area further.

## **Extra support**
- **Pharmacy First:** You can often get antibiotics for a simple UTI directly from a local pharmacy without seeing a GP (women aged 16–64).

## **When to get help**
**Call 111 or your GP urgently if:**
- You have a high fever, uncontrollable shivering, or pain in your sides/back (signs of kidney infection).
- You see blood in your urine.
- Your symptoms do not improve after 2 days of antibiotics.
- You are male or pregnant (these always require a GP check).

  eczema: `
## **Understanding your condition**
Atopic eczema is a condition where the skin is dry, itchy, and sensitive. It happens because the skin barrier is less oily than usual, letting moisture out and irritants in. It often runs in families and can flare up with stress or weather changes.

## **Things that can help**
- **Moisturise heavily:** Use your emollient cream generously and frequently (at least twice a day). This is the most important treatment.
- **Soap substitute:** Do not use normal soap or bubble bath, as they dry the skin. Wash with your emollient instead.
- **Stop the itch:** Scratching damages the skin. Tap or pinch the skin instead if it itches.
- **Steroids:** If prescribed steroid cream, apply it thinly *only* to the red, itchy active patches.

## **Extra support**
- **National Eczema Society:** Provides excellent fact sheets and support.
- **NHS.uk:** Watch the video "How to apply emollients" to ensure you are using enough.

## **When to get help**
Contact your GP or 111 if:
- The skin becomes weepy, crusted with yellow fluid, or very painful (signs of infection).
- The rash spreads rapidly.
- The eczema is affecting your sleep or daily life significantly.

  anxiety: `
## **Understanding your condition**
Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry, or fear. It is a normal reaction to stress, but it can become a problem if it is constant or stops you doing things. Physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, or dizziness are very common.

## **Things that can help**
- **Breathe:** Try "4-7-8 breathing". Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This physically calms your nervous system.
- **The "5-4-3-2-1" technique:** When panicked, name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste. This grounds you.
- **Limit triggers:** Caffeine and alcohol can mimic or trigger panic attacks.
- **Worry time:** Set aside 10 minutes a day to write down worries, then try to let them go for the rest of the day.

## **Extra support**
- **NHS Talking Therapies:** You can self-refer for CBT and counselling online without a GP letter.
- **Samaritans:** Call 116 123 for free, 24-hour listening support.

## **When to get help**
**Call 111 or your GP urgently if:**
- You have thoughts of harming yourself.
- Your anxiety is stopping you from leaving the house or working.
- You are having frequent panic attacks.

  reflux: `
## **Understanding your condition**
Acid reflux happens when stomach acid travels up towards the throat, causing a burning feeling or a sour taste. It is very common and usually caused by the muscle at the top of the stomach relaxing too much.

## **Things that can help**
- **Eat smaller meals:** Large meals expand the stomach and push acid up. Avoid eating 3 hours before bed.
- **Check your triggers:** Spicy food, caffeine, alcohol, fatty foods, and chocolate are common causes.
- **Sleep correctly:** Raise the head of your bed by 10-20cm using blocks, or use a wedge pillow. *Note: Do not just pile up extra pillows, as this bends your tummy and can make it worse.*
- **Weight:** If you are overweight, losing even a small amount reduces pressure on your stomach.

## **Extra support**
- **Your Pharmacy:** Ask about alginates (like Gaviscon) or omeprazole which can be bought over the counter.

## **When to get help**
Contact your GP if:
- **Food feels like it is sticking** in your throat when you swallow.
- You are losing weight without trying.
- You have persistent vomiting or vomit blood.
- You have had symptoms for more than 3 weeks despite treatment.
